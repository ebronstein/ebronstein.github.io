                  <p>Hi! I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by <a
                      href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/" target="_blank">Anca Dragan</a>. I'm also affiliated
                    with the <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley AI Research Lab</a>. I'm
                    broadly interested in human-AI interaction and creating systems that learn from and assist people.
                    My work is supported by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cise/CSGrad4US/" target="_blank">NSF

                    Waymax is a library for simulating and evaluating agents using scenarios instantiated from the Waymo
                    Open Motion Dataset. It is designed to support behavioral research (single and multi-agent planning,
                    behavior prediction, sim agents) using the minimal representation of objects and bounding boxes
                    adopted by the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, without the need for users to run their own perception
                    system from raw sensor data.

                    Waymax is entirely written using JAX, allowing users to easily run simulations on hardware
                    accelerators, write programs in a single computation graph, and take advantage of JAX’s functional
                    transforms such as JIT compilation.

                    ML-based motion planning is a promising approach to produce agents that exhibit complex behaviors,
                    and automatically adapt to novel environments. In the context of autonomous driving, it is common to
                    treat all available training data equally. However, this approach produces agents that do not
                    perform robustly in safety-critical settings, an issue that cannot be addressed by simply adding
                    more data to the training set - we show that an agent trained using only a 10% subset of the data
                    performs just as well as an agent trained on the entire dataset. We present a method to predict the
                    inherent difficulty of a driving situation given data collected from a fleet of autonomous vehicles
                    deployed on public roads. We then demonstrate that this difficulty score can be used in a zero-shot
                    transfer to generate curricula for an imitation-learning based planning agent. Compared to training
                    on the entire unbiased training dataset, we show that prioritizing difficult driving scenarios both
                    reduces collisions by 15% and increases route adherence by 14% in closed-loop evaluation, all while
                    using only 10% of the training data.

                    We demonstrate the first large-scale application of model-based generative adversarial imitation
                    learning (MGAIL) to the task of dense urban self-driving. We augment standard MGAIL using a
                    hierarchical model to enable generalization to arbitrary goal routes, and measure performance using
                    a closed-loop evaluation framework with simulated interactive agents. We train policies from expert
                    trajectories collected from real vehicles driving over 100,000 miles in San Francisco, and
                    demonstrate a steerable policy that can navigate robustly even in a zero-shot setting, generalizing
                    to synthetic scenarios with novel goals that never occurred in real-world driving. We also
                    demonstrate the importance of mixing closed-loop MGAIL losses with open-loop behavior cloning
                    losses, and show our best policy approaches the performance of the expert. We evaluate our imitative
                    model in both average and challenging scenarios, and show how it can serve as a useful prior to plan
                    successful trajectories.

                    The actions of an autonomous vehicle on the road affect and are affected by those of other drivers,
                    whether overtaking, negotiating a merge, or avoiding an accident. This mutual dependence, best
                    captured by dynamic game theory, creates a strong coupling between the vehicle's planning and its
                    predictions of other drivers' behavior, and constitutes an open problem with direct implications on
                    the safety and viability of autonomous driving technology. Unfortunately, dynamic games are too
                    computationally demanding to meet the real-time constraints of autonomous driving in its continuous
                    state and action space. In this paper, we introduce a novel game-theoretic trajectory planning
                    algorithm for autonomous driving, that enables real-time performance by hierarchically decomposing
                    the underlying dynamic game into a long-horizon" strategic" game with simplified dynamics and full
                    information structure, and a short-horizon" tactical" game with full dynamics and a simplified
                    information structure. The value of the strategic game is used to guide the tactical planning,
                    implicitly extending the planning horizon, pushing the local trajectory optimization closer to
                    global solutions, and, most importantly, quantitatively accounting for the autonomous vehicle and
                    the human driver's ability and incentives to influence each other. In addition, our approach admits
                    non-deterministic models of human decision-making, rather than relying on perfectly rational
                    predictions. Our results showcase richer, safer, and more effective autonomous behavior in
                    comparison to existing techniques.

                    Real-world autonomous vehicles often operate in a priori unknown environments. Since most of these
                    systems are safety-critical, it is important to ensure they operate safely in the face of
                    environment uncertainty, such as unseen obstacles. Current safety analysis tools enable autonomous
                    systems to reason about safety given full information about the state of the environment a priori.
                    However, these tools do not scale well to scenarios where the environment is being sensed in real
                    time, such as during navigation tasks. In this work, we propose a novel, real-time safety analysis
                    method based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability that provides strong safety guarantees despite
                    environment uncertainty. Our safety method is planner-agnostic and provides guarantees for a variety
                    of mapping sensors. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and in hardware to provide safety
                    guarantees around a state-of-the-art vision-based, learning-based planner.

                    Imitation learning (IL) is a simple and powerful way to use high-quality human driving data, which
                    can be collected at scale, to identify driving preferences and produce human-like behavior. However,
                    policies based on imitation learning alone often fail to sufficiently account for safety and
                    reliability concerns. In this paper, we show how imitation learning combined with reinforcement
                    learning using simple rewards can substantially improve the safety and reliability of driving
                    policies over those learned from imitation alone. In particular, we use a combination of imitation
                    and reinforcement learning to train a policy on over 100k miles of urban driving data, and measure
                    its effectiveness in test scenarios grouped by different levels of collision risk. To our knowledge,
                    this is the first application of a combined imitation and reinforcement learning approach in
                    autonomous driving that utilizes large amounts of real-world human driving data.

                    In many applications, uncertainty in the durations of tasks complicates the development of plans and
                    schedules. This has given rise to a range of resilient planning and scheduling techniques that in
                    some way rely on probabilistic models of task durations. In this paper we consider the problem of
                    using historical data to develop probabilistic task models for such planning and scheduling
                    techniques. We describe a novel, Bayesian hierarchical approach for constructing task duration
                    distributions from past data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in constructing predictive
                    probabilistic distribution models. Unlike traditional statistical learning techniques, the proposed
                    approach relies on minimal data, is inherently adaptive to time varying task duration distribution,
                    and provides a rich description of confidence for decision making. These ideas are demonstrated
                    using historical data provided by a local transit authority on bus dwell times at urban bus stops.
                    Our results show that the task distributions generated by our approach yield significantly more
                    accurate predictions than those generated by standard regression techniques.

                    Grasping, which focuses on enabling robots to manipulate objects, is challenging because of the
                    large space of possible grasps and object poses that must be considered. We seek to decrease the
                    complexity of planning grasps on objects by 1) segmenting a query object into parts, and 2)
                    transferring precomputed good grasps to these parts from parts of previously seen objects, with the
                    novel consideration that the query object and other object need not be from the same semantic class.

                    Deep learning models with a large number of parameters are often unnecessarily large and
                    time-consuming during both training and prediction. Policy distillation seeks to address this
                    concern by distilling the policy from a larger teacher network to a smaller student network. We aim
                    to improve the student network’s training sample complexity by considering 1) how a student
                    network’s exploration strategy affects its learning behavior, and 2) how a student network can
                    efficiently learn from multiple teachers of varying expertise.

                    To address the first question, we conduct experiments with teacher and student Deep Q-Networks in
                    the Pong environment and test several student exploration strategies (greedy, epsilon-greedy,
                    Boltzmann, and Bayesian exploration with dropout), finding that greedy and Bayesian strategies
                    result in minimal sample complexity.

                    To explore the second question, we pose the problem of multi-teacher single-task policy distillation
                    as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the teachers are the arms and the payoffs are the rewards the
                    student receives after learning from the teachers. We show that non-contextual bandit algorithms
                    such as random, epsilon-greedy, and UCB1 perform well when learning from multiple teachers, and UCB1
                    learns efficiently even when the teachers are of varying expertise. We also suggest how contextual
                    bandit algorithms can use the state observation to decide which teacher to learn from, thus learning
                    a holistic policy over the entire state space from teachers that are experts in subparts of the
                    state space.
